// 6 kyu - Mnemonic Lookup

// Mnemonics are wonderful tools to help us remember the order of things that we might otherwise have trouble remembering.

// This kata comes with preloaded global objects where key : value pairs represents the word in the mnemonic and the actual word - respectively. Keys are always lowercase strings.

// For example see, the two objects - rainbow and hardness below:

// ```javascript const rainbow = { run: 'red', over: 'orange', your: 'yellow', garden: 'green', bringing: 'blue', in: 'indigo', violets: 'violet' }

// const hardness = { tall: 'Talc', gyroscopes: 'Gypsum', can: 'Calcite', fly: 'Fluorite', apart: 'Apatite', orbiting: 'Orthoclase', quickly: 'Quartz', to: 'Topaz', complete: 'Corundum', disintegration: 'Diamond' }```

// Notice how the keys (run over your garden bringing in violets) provide the mnemonic for the values (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).

// Your task is to write a mnemonic lookup function. The function will take two arguments: group and word.

// The [Group] argument identifies the preloaded object, (eg: rainbow and hardness). The [Word] argument identifies a key from that object, (eg: run from the rainbow object).

// If the [Group] argument identifies an object that doesn’t exist, (for example, there is no object called blue), then return a string: “There is no mnemonic for this.”

// If the [Group] does exist (eg: rainbow) but does not include the [Word] as a key (eg: rainbow does not include the key rose) then return a string: "You're onto something, but still quite far off.".

// If the [Group] does exist (eg: rainbow) and does have [Word] as a key (eg: run), then return the value for that key (ie: red).
